The goal of this project is to optimize the workflow of tasks when creating orders in my business enviroment.  
The user can easily make an order to, then email it to the subcontractors.  
The user should easily scroll through customers, and select what job that needs to be done.  
After the user has filled in important information, the application then generates a pdf file.  
Users can easily add new customers via txt file (.json).   
The application manipulates pdf files with the help of iText


## Why?
Because our business studio is extremly slow.  
And the orders needs to be deleted in our studio afterwards.  

## Goals?
1. **Refactoring :)**  
2. The application connects with our business studio DB to find the customer/store info.  
(As of now the application is using an txt for customers)
